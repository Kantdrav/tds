Great! You have the JSON body ready to get embeddings. Hereâ€™s how to actually send this request and get the embeddings using the terminal with curl (or any HTTP client):
Using curl in terminal

    Save your JSON body in a file called, for example, embedding_request.json:

{
  "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
  "input": [
    "Dear user, please verify your transaction code 76713 sent to 21f3002792@ds.study.iitm.ac.in",
    "Dear user, please verify your transaction code 47159 sent to 21f3002792@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"
  ]
}

    Run this curl command, replacing YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key:

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d @embedding_request.json

What happens next?

    The API responds with a JSON containing embeddings (vectors) for each input text.

    You can then feed these embeddings into your fraud detection ML model.

If you want to do it programmatically (Python example):

import requests

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
}

data = {
    "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "input": [
        "Dear user, please verify your transaction code 76713 sent to 21f3002792@ds.study.iitm.ac.in",
        "Dear user, please verify your transaction code 47159 sent to 21f3002792@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())
